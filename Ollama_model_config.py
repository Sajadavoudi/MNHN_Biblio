Your task is to analyze the provided paragraph from a scientific paper and determine if it mentions specimens from the MNHN of Paris (Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris) collections. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Verify MNHN Collection Reference**:
   - Check if the paragraph contains a reference to an MNHN collection code (in the format "MNHN.some_number").

2. **Identify Specimen Scientific Name**:
   - If an MNHN collection code is present, identify the specific scientific name(s) of the specimen(s) explicitly mentioned in the same paragraph.
   - Ensure the name is scientific (e.g., *Genus species*), not a generic description or placeholder.

3. **Output Format**:
   - If a scientific name of an specimen comes from MNHN or Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle collection code, return only and only the specific name(s), separated by commas.
   - If no scientific name is explicitly linked to the MNHN collection code, return only and only the word "None".

4. **Focus**:
   - Ensure the analysis is precise and strictly based on explicit information in the paragraph.
   - Avoid assumptions or interpreting information that is not clearly stated.
   - Do not return any additional text, explanations, or metadata.

Here are examples to guide your task:
Input: "Specimen X (MNHN.F.12345) was examined... *Homo sapiens* was identified."
Output: Homo sapiens

Input: "No MNHN collection codes were mentioned."
Output: None
